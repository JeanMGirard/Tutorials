# Error reporting

## Advantages

**Root-cause analysis**: 
With searchable, detailed information on the operating system, device, timing, and more, it helps trace an error to its root.

**Trail of events**: 
Breadcrumbs make application development a little easier by showing you the trails of events that lead to the error(s).

**Git integrations**: 
Create issues in your git solutions automatically.

**Understand the impact**: 
Receive detailed analysis of error distributions and timelines
